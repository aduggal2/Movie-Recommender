# Movie Recommender [Data-Mining-II]

1. The goal of the final project is to create a recommendation system for movies using advanced algorithms for mining big data. 
2. The MovieLens 25M Dataset, which includes 25 million ratings for 62,423 movies from 162,541 users.

3. The dataset is split into two CSV files: movies.csv and ratings.csv. 
4. The data is pre-processed by extracting the movie year from the title, cleaning the movie title, and dropping duplicate movies with the same title and year. 
5. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) graphs are created to understand the distribution of ratings, number of ratings per movie and user, and the number of movies per year. 
6. Content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, Sparse representation, and matrix factorization using SVD are used to build the recommendation system.
